<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am a recent graduate from the University Of British Columbia in Computer Science and am further enhancing my skills in the art of programming. I have built a passion for the web development aspect of things and have
  thus pursued this field in computer science. 
</p>

<p>Some hobbies I have outside of coding are things like martial arts in which I am very passionate about. I am currently learning, boxing, kickboxing, and muay thai. 
  I also enjoy spending time with family, my dog, and friends!</p>

<p>I am going to continue working hard everyday to further refine my skills and become a better developer over time.</p>
